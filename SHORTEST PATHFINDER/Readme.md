# AGENT vs Maze
This program uses C++ and SFML Library. The Agent will follow a path determined by the underlying algorithm to reach its Goal.
The results are interesting on smaller boards since performance for the algorithms is the same and interesting enough the  BFS AND DFS  even somehow perform better than Astar but for larger boards thats where we see Astar search absolutely demolish BFS and DFS.
