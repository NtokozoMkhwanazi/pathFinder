# Data structures shortest path Finder
shortest path finding algorithms visualized using sfml.
check the Shortest pathfinder folder, This folder contains different algorithms which try to solve the randomized maze including a snake agent that tries to solve the maze (also randomize the goal post). Currently it has 4 solving algorithms. Astar search perfoms better than Breadth First Search and Depth first search on larger boards or the more complex the boards are. This is open for development, a variation of  algorithms can be used to try solve this in the quickest time possible. im just benchmarking the algrithms.
