# Data structures shortest path Finder
shortest path finding algorithms visualized using sfml.
check the Shortest pathfinder folder, This folder contains different algorithms which try to solve the randomized maze including a snake agent that tries to solve the maze (also randomize the goal post). Currently it has 4 solving algorithms.A star search  is better than Breadth First Search and Depth first search but for larger boards or more complex the boards are. This is open for development.
