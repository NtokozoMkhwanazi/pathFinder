# Data structures shortest path Finder
shortest path finding algorithms by visualizing them using sfml.
check the Shortest pathfinder, This folder contains different algorithms which try to solve the randomized maze (we could also randomize the goal post). Currently it has 4 solving algorithms which is the A star search which is better ofcause it is anyway  then Breadth First Search and Depth first search. This is open for development.
