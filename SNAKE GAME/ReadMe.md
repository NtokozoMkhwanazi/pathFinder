# Snake algorithms
This might be a bit decieving but the game is still in development.This instead for now is a vizualization of a snake trying to traverse a board with static obstacles and dynamic obstacles to reach a goal post which is randomized for each new board.
creating this into a game would be a bit tough since its not a normal snake board but who cares we're programmers we love a challenge so im guessing movement should be continous but the direction can be read from the keyboard thus changing the direction of the snake . Pretty cool i gues but my question is will it be easier for a human to both avoid the dynamically and static obstacles because the dynamically rendered obstacles could pop at any spot and they are quick, so it could be had to nevigate my friends will hate this :). or maybe if you hit the dynamic obstacle the snake shrinks by single block and if you reach the goal it grows by two blocks and if you hit the static obstacles you're dead.
