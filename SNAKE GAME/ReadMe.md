# Snake algorithms
This might be a bit decieving but the game is still in development.This instead for now is a vizualization of a snake trying to traverse a board with static obstacles and dynamic obstacles to reach a goal post which is randomized for each new board using an A star search algorith and BFS algorithm.

 # my thoughts for the snake game  ? 
Creating this into a game would be a little bit tricky since its not a normal snake board (dynamic and static obstacles add some complexity) and we want the game to playable, movement should be continous but the direction can be read from the keyboard thus changing the direction of the snake  . 
Question is will it be easier for a human like it is for Algorithms e.g A star search to both avoid the dynamic and static obstacles ? no . because the dynamically rendered obstacles could pop at any spot and they are quick, so it could be had to navigate. or maybe when you hit the dynamic obstacle the snake shrinks by single block and if you reach the goal it grows by two blocks and if you hit the static obstacles you're dead. then build from there!. then other things like score etc .
