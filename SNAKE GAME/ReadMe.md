# Snake algorithms
This might be a bit decieving but the game is still in development.This instead for now is a vizualization of a snake trying to traverse a board with static obstacles and dynamic obstacles to reach a goal post which is randomized for each new board.
craating this into a game wouldbe hard since it will be adding movement should be continous but the direction can be read from the keyboard thus changing the course of the snake . Pretty cool i gues but my question is will it be easier for a human to both avoid the dynamically and static obstacles because the dynamically rendered obstacles could pop at any spot and they are quick so it could be had to nevigate .feel free to knock yourself out . like i said im somewhat of a programmer :)
